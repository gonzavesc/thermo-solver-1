# Thermodynamics Simulation
Heat Transfer simulator using a Finite Volumes solver for *Gas Dynamics*

## Phase 1 (*currently under development*)
- 2D transient conduction analysis with multiple materials

## Phase 2
- Navier-Stokes discretization: mass + momentum + (energy)

## Phase 3
- Convection with 2D laminar flow

## Phase 4
- Convection with 3D turbulent flow
