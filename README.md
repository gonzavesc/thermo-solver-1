# Thermodynamics Simulation
Heat Transfer simulator using a Finite Volumes solver for *Gas Dynamics*

## Instructions
First of all, make sure [`g++-6`](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-toolchain-r/+archive/ubuntu/test) is installed and available in the `$PATH`. Then:
```bash
make # compile all them files
./thermo # run the simulator!
```

## Features
### Phase 1 (*currently under development*)
- 2D transient conduction analysis with multiple materials

#### Phase 1A
- Smallest mesh discretization for all materials, using a line-by-line solver
- Parallel computation of horizontal and vertical lines

#### Phase 1B
- Independent mesh discretization for each material, using a Gauss-Seidel solver for internal boundary nodes
- Parallel computation of each material region

### Phase 2
- Navier-Stokes discretization: mass + momentum + (energy)

### Phase 3
- Convection with 2D laminar flow

### Phase 4
- Convection with 3D turbulent flow
